# Local Government Public Meetings Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and analysis for our project on analyzing local government public meeting transcripts. The project aims to gain insights into meeting frequency, topics of discussion, sentiment trends, engagement metrics, and meeting duration across various states and years.

## Collaborators

- Daniel Geyshis
- Hila Ashkenazi

## Project Overview

Our project involved a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing local government public meeting transcripts in the US. The dataset included meetings from diverse locations, spanning multiple years. Our analysis encompassed various aspects of the data, including meeting frequency, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, engagement metrics, and meeting duration.

## Work Division

We divided the work equally, with each collaborator taking on specific tasks:

- Daniel Geyshis:
  - Meeting Frequency Analysis
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Topic Analysis

- Hila Ashkenazi:
  - Heat Map Visualization
  - Word Cloud Visualization
  - Meeting Duration Analysis

## Key Insights

Our collaboration yielded several key insights:

- Meeting frequency has shown a steady increase over the years, with a focus on the state of California. The analysis suggests a gradual expansion of the dataset to include more states.
- Sentiment analysis revealed that the majority of meetings expressed positive sentiment, while some years and states exhibited unique sentiment patterns.
- The topic analysis graph highlighted associations between states and specific themes discussed during meetings.
- Engagement metrics indicated that shorter videos tend to attract more likes and comments, whereas longer videos have higher view counts.
- The heatmap visualization illustrated the distribution of public meetings across different states and provided insights into regions with heightened demand for civic involvement.

## Future Work

While we've covered various aspects of the dataset, there are still opportunities for further research:

- Exploring external factors that influence meeting dynamics and sentiment trends.
- Implementing advanced natural language processing techniques for more nuanced topic modeling.
- Investigating how meeting duration and engagement metrics are affected by specific topics of discussion.

## Conclusion

Our collaborative effort has resulted in a comprehensive analysis of local government public meeting transcripts. By combining our expertise, we've gained valuable insights into civic engagement dynamics and highlighted avenues for future exploration. The project showcases the potential of data analysis in enhancing public participation and decision-making processes.
